# Deployment Guide

This guide provides instructions for deploying the Federated Learning framework for Privacy-Preserving Collaborative AI in IoT Communication Networks.

## Prerequisites

1. **Install Required Packages**: Ensure you have Python and the required packages installed.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Data Generation**: Generate synthetic data required for model training.
    ```bash
    python data_generation/generate_data.py
    ```

## Local Deployment

1. **Train Local Models**: Train the local models using the provided script.
    ```bash
    python model_training/local_training.py
    ```

2. **Federated Averaging**: Perform federated averaging to aggregate the local models into a global model.
    ```bash
    python model_training/federated_averaging.py
    ```

3. **Evaluate Models**: Evaluate the performance of the trained models.
    ```bash
    python evaluation/evaluate_model.py
    ```

## Experimentation

1. **Run Experiment 1**: Conduct the first experiment which includes training and evaluation.
    ```bash
    python experiments/experiment1.py
    ```

2. **Run Experiment 2**: Conduct the second experiment which includes federated averaging and evaluation.
    ```bash
    python experiments/experiment2.py
    ```

3. **Run Experiment 3**: Conduct the third experiment which includes applying differential privacy and evaluation.
    ```bash
    python experiments/experiment3.py
    ```

## Visualization

1. **Training History**: Visualize the training history of the models.
2. **Confusion Matrix**: Visualize the confusion matrix to understand the model's performance.

## Security and Privacy

1. **Differential Privacy**: Implement differential privacy to ensure data privacy.
    ```bash
    python security/differential_privacy.py
    ```

2. **Secure Aggregation**: Implement secure aggregation to enhance the security of the federated learning process.
    ```bash
    python security/secure_aggregation.py
    ```

## Deployment on Cloud

For deploying the framework on the cloud, you can use platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. The deployment process involves:

1. **Setting Up Virtual Machines**: Provision virtual machines to act as IoT devices.
2. **Data Distribution**: Distribute the synthetic data across the virtual machines.
3. **Model Training**: Train the local models on each virtual machine.
4. **Federated Averaging**: Aggregate the local models into a global model on a central server.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the global model's performance.

Refer to the cloud provider's documentation for specific instructions on setting up and managing virtual machines and other resources.
